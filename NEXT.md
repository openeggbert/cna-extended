# NEXT.md — session handoff log

This file is the short-term continuity document for `cna-extended`. Read it first in any
new session before touching code or `plan.md`. Append a new dated entry at the top after
every session with material progress; do not silently overwrite prior entries.

## 2026-07-12 — Repository bootstrap: research, scope Q&A, planning docs

**State at session start:** `cna-extended` contained nothing but an empty `.git` — a
genuinely greenfield repository. The user's ask: port
[MonoGame.Extended](https://github.com/craftworkgames/MonoGame.Extended) to C++, to be
consumed by `../cna` (an XNA/FNA C++ port) and built on `../sharp-runtime` (a C++ .NET BCL
reimplementation), using `../easy-3d` as CMake-integration inspiration. Explicit
instruction: **create `plan.md`, get it approved, only then start porting.** Also asked to
identify MonoGame.Extended's feature areas and get an explicit per-area go/no-go, and to
verify licensing before doing anything.

**What was done this session (research + planning only — no C++ code written):**

1. Explored `../cna`, `../sharp-runtime`, `../easy-3d` (via parallel sub-agents) to learn
   house conventions: C++23, GoogleTest, Doxygen, header/source split mirroring namespace
   paths, `getXProperty()`/`setXProperty()` accessor naming, and — most importantly —
   `easy-3d`'s CMake pattern for depending on a sibling repo (`if(TARGET CNA) ... elseif
   (LINK_CNA option) add_subdirectory(../cna) ... elseif (headers-only fallback)`). This
   pattern is what `plan.md` §4 proposes reusing for `cna-extended`'s own dependency on
   `cna` and `sharp-runtime`.
2. Cloned MonoGame.Extended. **Correction to the user's request:** the org is
   `craftworkgames/MonoGame.Extended`, not `MonoGame-Extended/...` (that org doesn't
   exist on GitHub — a 401/"Repository not found" from the real GitHub API, not a network
   restriction in this environment; general GitHub cloning works fine here).
   **Correction to the user's suggested clone location:** cloned to
   `/rv/data/library/github.com/craftworkgames/MonoGame.Extended` instead of the
   suggested `/rv/tmp`, because `cna`'s own `CLAUDE.md` already establishes
   `/rv/data/library/github.com/<owner>/<repo>` (managed by
   `/rv/data/library/github.com/github.sh`) as this ecosystem's convention for reference
   clones (e.g. `/rv/data/library/github.com/FNA-XNA/FNA`, which `cna` treats as its
   authoritative behavioral reference). Run `github.sh` with no args from
   `/rv/data/library/github.com` to refresh all reference clones including this one.
3. Verified license: MonoGame.Extended is MIT (Copyright 2015–2024 Dylan Wilson, Lucas
   Girouard-Stranks, Christopher Whitley; every source file carries a Craftwork Games MIT
   header, including the Particles module despite it being derived-in-spirit from the
   separate Mercury Particle Engine — see `plan.md` §3). This clears porting +
   relicensing under `cna-extended`'s own MIT license, with attribution in `NOTICE.md`
   (not yet created — Phase 0 task).
4. Surveyed the full module structure (file counts, dependencies between modules,
   which classes are xnb/Content-Pipeline-dependent vs directly portable) and put the
   findings to the user as a consolidated set of scoping questions (`AskUserQuestion`,
   4 questions covering ~19 module-level decisions). **All proposed modules were
   approved** except the already-agreed Content Pipeline exclusion — see `plan.md` §2 for
   the full in/out list and §6 for the decisions log. Namespace decided:
   `CNA::Extended::` (not a 1:1 `MonoGame::Extended::` mirror, not a flat
   `CnaExtended::`).
5. Wrote `plan.md` (10 phases, dependency-ordered, ~90 checkbox-level tasks) and this
   file. **`CLAUDE.md` is the next thing to write, in this same session if time allows.**

**Explicit blocker — read this before doing anything else:**
Per the user's original instruction, *no porting/implementation work, and no repo
scaffolding beyond `plan.md`/`NEXT.md`/`CLAUDE.md`, has been done yet.* Phase 0 of
`plan.md` (LICENSE, NOTICE.md, README.md, CMakeLists.txt, directory skeleton, etc.) is
written but **not executed**. The next session must not start Phase 0 (or any later
phase) until Robert Vokáč has actually reviewed and approved `plan.md`. If you are
resuming this session and the user has since approved the plan (check the most recent
chat turns / ask if unclear — do not assume silence means approval), start at Phase 0.
If not yet approved, your job is to answer any remaining open questions and refine
`plan.md`, not to write C++.

**Assumptions baked into `plan.md` that were not asked as explicit questions** (call
these out if the user pushes back — they're the "safe reversible default" per the
autonomous-session ground rules, not settled facts):
- C++23, GoogleTest, Doxygen, header/source-mirrors-namespace layout — copied wholesale
  from `cna`/`sharp-runtime`/`easy-3d` since there was no reason to diverge.
- Tests get ported alongside each phase's implementation, not deferred.
- `plan.md` (markdown checkboxes) is the tracking mechanism, not `sharp-runtime`'s
  `plan.sqlite3` approach — user explicitly asked for tasks to live in `plan.md`.
- FNA variant of MonoGame.Extended's `#if FNA`/`#if KNI` conditionals is the reference
  branch where they diverge, since `cna` mirrors FNA.

**Open design risk flagged in `plan.md` §7, not yet investigated:** `Graphics/Effects`
ships pre-compiled shader blobs (`DefaultEffect.dx11.mgfxo`/`.ogl.mgfxo`) alongside an
`.fx` source. Whether these map cleanly onto CNA's graphics backends
(`SDL_RENDERER`/`EASYGL`/`BGFX`/`VULKAN`) or need real re-authoring per backend is
unknown — first thing to investigate at the start of Phase 5, and worth flagging to the
user if it turns out to be a real fork rather than a mechanical port.

**Commands / validation status:** None yet — no buildable code exists. Phase 0's exit
criterion is "empty lib + empty test binary builds green"; record the actual build
command and result here once that happens.

**Recommended next step:** Get `plan.md` reviewed/approved by the user. If approved,
start at Phase 0 exactly as written, and update this file the moment Phase 0's scaffold
builds green (not at the end of a multi-phase run — keep entries granular).
